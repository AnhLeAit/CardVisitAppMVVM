# Card visit app with MVVM & Unit Test
The main purpose of this app is to show MVVM sample implementation using the new Google [Android Architecture Components][1] (ViewModel, DataBinding, LiveData, ConstraintLayout and AndroidX inside) along with [Room][2] database and [Dagger 2][3] dependency injection to build a robust application (scalable, testable, easy to maintain and landscape mode, never leak data when screen rotation with [LiveData][8]). Unit test with JUnit4, Mockito. Use an Android UI instrumentation test with [Espresso][7].

## App
This Java version is my homework test for Android Dev at **be Corporation Vietnam**
1. UI requirements:
- Click on app icon > Show list of card visit (support paging, load 50 item/page)
- Click card item > Show card details
- Click add new card > Show screen add new card
- Click save button > save card in local storage then back to list screen
and display new card at the top of the list
- In home screen user can filter by name or phone number

2. Rest API and segment show in List order:
API get list of card visit from 2 API as following
- List card saved by Room DB (Segment 1)
- http://demo8104666.mockable.io/cards (Segment 2)
- http://demo7527907.mockable.io/cards/<pageIndexâ€‹ from 1-4>  (Segment 3)


### Architecture overview

<img src="/.assets/mvvm-architecture.png" width="500" height="375"/>

- **di:** Dagger 2 implementation to provide in need object for Retrofit API and ViewModel constructor.
- **service:** REST full implement and Room DB to making a Repository access both Web and Local data sources.
- **util:** Some app utils and constants.
- **view:** UI components with DataBinding, ConstraintLayout, Adapters and screen activities.
- **viewmodel:** Implement ViewModel class content LiveData and data logic to show at Views.


### Testing

JUnit 4, [Mockito][4], [Espresso][7] for automated UI testing.

Make a robust application with Unit test

#### JUnit [test](/app/src/test)
- Models basic test.
- ViewModel unit test with Mockito and [LiveData Testing](https://github.com/jraska/livedata-testing) library.

#### User interface and interactions [test](/app/src/androidTest)
- Room DB test.
- Espresso for UI screen flow test.
